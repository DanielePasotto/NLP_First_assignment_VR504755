calcinosis cutis  is a type of calcinosis wherein calcium deposits form in the skin.  a variety of factors can result in this condition.  the most common source is dystrophic calcification, which occurs in soft tissue as a response to injury.  in addition, calcinosis is seen in limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis, also known as crest syndrome (the "c" in crest). in dogs, calcinosis cutis is found in young, large breed dogs and is thought to occur after a traumatic injury.

causes
calcinosis may result from a variety of causes such as:

trauma to the region
inflammation (bug bites, acne)
varicose veins
infections
tumors (malignant or benign)
diseases of connective tissue
hypercalcemia
hyperphosphatemiacalcinosis cutis is associated with systemic sclerosis.

diagnosis
types
calcinosis cutis may be divided into the following types:: 527–530 
dystrophic calcinosis cutis
metastatic calcinosis cutis
iatrogenic calcinosis cutis
traumatic calcinosis cutis
idiopathic calcinosis cutis
idiopathic scrotal calcinosis
subepidermal calcified nodule
tumoral calcinosis
osteoma cutis

treatment
intralesional corticosteroids may be beneficial. colchicine has been shown to be effective in certain populations. the efficacy of other treatments, such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sodium etidronate, diphosphonates and diltiazem is unclear, but they have been reported to be serviceable in refractory calcinosis. surgical options may be considered, particularly if there is associated ulceration.

history
the evolution of this institution dates back to the beginning of the 19th century. it started as a small dispensary in the form of a first aid centre in the premises of the present medical college during the days of maharatha rule in the later half of the eighteenth century. the sole purpose of that dispensary was to render whatever little medical assistance was available and feasible to the sick pilgrims en route to and from puri, especially during the "car festival" of lord jagannath.
this dispensary continued to function admirably till the british occupation of orissa in 1803. the british rulers, in due course of time, realized the strategic importance of this dispensary at cuttack and converted it into small hospital. for the smooth management of the hospital, they made provisions for pumping adequate money from the "annachhatra fund".

in 1875, the orissa medical school was born by the effort of a madras (chennai) born scottish dr william day stewart, the then civil surgeon of cuttack as its first principal. he mooted out the idea of starting a medical school, utilizing this hospital as an infrastructural nucleus. in this endeavour, he received the kind support and sincere patronage of the then lt governor, sir richard temple and the divisional commissioner, mr. t.e ravenshaw. dr. william day stewart who took the initiative in setting up the medical and stewart school passed away on 23 november 1890 at the age 50 and was buried at the local 'gora kabar' cemetery.

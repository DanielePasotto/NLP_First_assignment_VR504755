education and training
the new america foundation has criticized medical assistant programs, particularly those run by profit-making schools like kaplan and everest college. some graduates of the school cannot find full-time work, or cannot find work at all, cannot make enough to pay their loans, and go into default. according to the department of labor, median annual salary for medical assistants in 2011 was $29,100, but students with medical-assistant certificates typically earned less than $20,000. in some programs, graduates earned less than $15,080, the minimum wage, which means they were working part-time. for example, drake college of business, elizabeth, nj, charges $18,000, but 31% of graduates defaulted on loans. a few public community colleges have successful programs where graduates make more than $25,000 a year.in the u.s., an institution's medical assisting program may be accredited by the commission on accreditation of allied health education programs (caahep) or the accrediting bureau of health education schools (abhes) if its graduates plan to become certified or registered. accreditation is a requirement of certification agencies such as the american association of medical assistants (aama), the american medical technologists (amt) and the national health career association (nha). currently there are in excess of 600 caahep accredited programs in can than 500 institutions, and more than 200 accredited by abhes. accreditation by caahep, abhes or other accreditation associations requires that the institution's medical assisting program meets specific educational standards and provides sufficient classroom, lecture, and laboratory time.

certification
professional certification is a way to measure competency of a medical assistant at an entry-level job. certification for medical assistants is voluntary and optional, though encouraged by the american association of medical assistants (aama) and a number of other certification bodies. employers increasingly prefer or even require that the medical assistants they hire be certified.in the united states, different organizations certify medical assistants. for one, the american association of medical assistants (aama) was founded in 1956. certification may be achieved by taking the cma (aama) certification examination offered by the aama certifying board in consultation with the national board of medical examiners, which also administers many national exams for physicians. the cma (aama) exam is offered throughout the year at computer-based testing centers across the country. only individuals who have successfully completed a caahep or abhes accredited medical assisting program are eligible for the cma (aama) certification examination. those who successfully complete the cma (aama) certification examination earn the cma (aama) credential, a title which then follows postnominally. a cma (aama) must re-certify every 60 months by continuing education or re-examination in order to maintain certification.
other credential options include becoming a registered medical assistant (rma). credentialing is voluntary. the american medical technologists (amt) agency is responsible for certifying mas who choose this course. the amt first began offering this certification in 1972. amt has its own conventions and committees, bylaws, state chapters, officers, registrations, and re validation examinations. to become eligible to hold the title of rma, a student must either pass a medical assisting curriculum at a school that accredited by the national commission for certifying agencies (ncca), or possess a minimum of five years experience.
the national center for competency testing (ncct) is an independent credentialing organization that has administered more than 400,000 certification exams across the united states since 1989. its national certified medical assistant certification program has earned accreditation by the national commission for certifying agencies (ncca). candidates who meet all medical assistant eligibility requirements and pass the ncct national certification examination earn the credential ncma (ncct). ncct accepts candidates from approved medical assistant programs in colleges/universities and provides additional experiential-based qualifying routes. once certified, the ncma (ncct) must complete 14 clock hours of continuing education annually to maintain the credential.

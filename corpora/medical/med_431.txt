history
hosmer johnson, nathan smith davis, ralph isham, edmund andrews, david rutter and william byford co-founded the medical department of lind university on october 11, 1859. it was renamed the chicago medical college in 1863, and affiliated with northwestern university in 1870.
the woman's medical college of chicago, established in 1870 as the woman's hospital medical college, became affiliated with northwestern in 1892 as northwestern university woman's medical school. the college closed in 1902 as other schools in chicago and the nation began accepting women.
in 1906, the chicago medical college was renamed northwestern university medical school. it had occupied buildings on the near south side of chicago from 1863 until the montgomery ward memorial building was constructed in streeterville in 1926.
northwestern university medical school was renamed the feinberg school of medicine in 2002, reflecting a $75 million donation from the joseph and bessie feinberg foundation. reuben feinberg started to donate to the university after being hospitalized at northwestern memorial hospital for a heart attack. the first donation, in 1988, was for $17 million to establish the feinberg cardiovascular research institute. a $10 million donation was subsequently sent in 1996 to establish the frances evelyn feinberg clinical neurosciences institute.
in 2012, feinberg's entering medical students began a new curriculum, organized into three phases and emphasizing integration of four main curricular elements: science in medicine, clinical medicine, health & society, and professional development. the goal was to build a more learner-centered educational program that (1) fully integrates scientific principles in a clinical context; (2) stimulates inquiry and investigation; (3) has an assessment system that comprehensively evaluates student achievement in each of the core competencies; (4) reinforces a culture of learning, teamwork, and excellence; (5) is flexible and able to meet the unique needs of individual students as they learn and differentiate.on september 1, 2013, northwestern medical faculty foundation, the medical school's physician's group, joined northwestern memorial healthcare (nmhc), the health system that includes northwestern memorial hospital, forming a new physician's group called northwestern medical group. together, nmhc and feinberg jointly share the brand "northwestern medicine."on may 8, 2015, exactly 90 years after northwestern university first broke ground on its chicago campus, feinberg broke ground on the louis a. simpson and kimberly k. querrey biomedical research center. the building opened in june 2019 and added more than 625,000 square feet and 12 stories of research space to the downtown campus.

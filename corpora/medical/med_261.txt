products
linear accelerators
varian manufactures a range of megavoltage linacs with varying levels of features and complexity, for example different numbers of multileaf collimators or the ability to perform radiosurgery.truebeam is a radiotherapy system.the edge radiosurgery suite was launched in 2012. the first cancer centers to use the new system were the champalimaud foundation in lisbon, portugal and henry ford health system in detroit, michigan.

halcyon
in 2017, varian launched halcyon. the system features unique dual-layer mlc that enables high modulation with low leakage for every field or arc. halcyon is advertised to be intuitive, friendly and comfortable for clinical staff and patient alike. this is primarily done by automating several functions typically performed manually by radiographers, such as switching between treatment beams automatically. additionally, halcyon also features an automated machine performance check for daily linac quality assurance, which can speed up the checking of beam constancy and mechanical performance through the use of a phantom.however, while halcyon does boast improved automation and workflow improvements which allow for faster patient treatment, these extra automation tasks can make occasionally make it more difficult for medical physicists to perform detailed quality assurance on linac performance. nevertheless, automation in both quality assurance and clinical operation generally make the linac easier to operate by checkers and radiation therapists.

an academic medical centre (amc), variously also known as academic health science centre, academic health science system, or academic health science partnership, is an educational and healthcare institute formed by the grouping of a health professional school (such as a medical school) with an affiliated teaching hospital or hospital network.
amcs are intended to ensure that medical research breakthroughs lead to direct clinical benefits for patients. the organisational structures that comprise an amcs can take a variety of forms, ranging from simple partnerships to, less frequently, fully integrated organisations with a single management board. there are amcs operating in a number of countries including australia, canada, the republic of ireland, japan, the netherlands, qatar, singapore, sweden, the united kingdom and the united states.

origins
since 1837, the village of jamaica, queens, had been served by the stagecoach. in 1883, the long island rail road opened its atlantic branch to brooklyn, making jamaica a suburb of new york city. the residents held a fundraiser in 1883 and collected $179.40 (equivalent to $5,634 in 2022). this money was saved until the jamaica hospital was opened in 1891 near what is now jamaica avenue and 169th street. at that time the founders applied to state officials for a certificate of incorporation, which was granted on february 20, 1892.jamaica hospital's first permanent location opened on june 18, 1898, near the union hall street station on the east side of new york avenue (guy brewer blvd), a short distance north of south street. the new hospital building opened on may 1, and despite not being ready to fully receive patients, admitted its first patients several days later. due to an influx of wounded during the spanishâ€“american war, by july every available space was occupied by soldiers.

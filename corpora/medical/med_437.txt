history
early history
in 1819, cincinnati college and the medical college of ohio were founded in cincinnati. local benefactor daniel drake
founded and funded the medical college of ohio. william lytle of the lytle family donated the land, funded the cincinnati college and law college, and served as its first president. the college survived only six years before financial difficulties forced it to close. in 1835, daniel drake reestablished the institution, which eventually joined with the cincinnati law school.in 1858, charles mcmicken died of pneumonia and in his will he allocated most of his estate to the city of cincinnati to found a university. the university of cincinnati was chartered by the ohio legislature in 1870  after delays by livestock and veal lobbyists angered by the liberal arts-centered curriculum and lack of agricultural and manufacturing emphasis. the university's board of rectors changed the institution's name to the university of cincinnati.

expansion and 20th century
by 1893, the university expanded beyond its primary location on clifton avenue and relocated to its present location in the heights neighborhood. as the university expanded, the rectors merged the institution with cincinnati law school, establishing the university of cincinnati college of law. in 1896, the ohio medical college joined miami medical college to form the ohio-miami medical department of the university of cincinnati in 1909. as political movements for temperance and suffrage grew, the university established teacher's college in 1905 and a graduate school in the college of arts and sciences in 1906. the  queen city college of pharmacy, acquired from wilmington college (ohio), became the present james l. winkle college of pharmacy.in 1962, the cincinnati college-conservatory of music was acquired by the university. the ohio legislature in columbus declared the university a "municipally-sponsored, state-affiliated" institution in 1968. during this time, the university of cincinnati was the second oldest and second-largest municipal university in the united states.

modern history
by an act of the ohio legislature, the university of cincinnati became a state institution in 1977.in 1989, president joseph a. steger released a master plan for a stronger academy. over this time, the university invested nearly $2 billion in campus construction, renovation, and expansion ranging from the student union to a new recreation center to the medical school. it included renovation and construction of multiple buildings, a campus forest, and a university promenade. the plan also includes the sigma sigma commons, which was completed in 1998 as a part of the organization's centennial.upon her inauguration in 2005, president nancy l. zimpher developed the uc21 plan, designed to redefine cincinnati as a leading urban research university. in addition, it includes putting liberal arts education at the center, increasing research funding, and expanding involvement in the city.in 2009, gregory h. williams was named the 27th president of the university of cincinnati. his presidency expanded the accreditation and property of the institution to regions throughout ohio to compete with private and specialized state institutions, such as ohio state university. his administration focused on maintaining the integrity and holdings of the university.  he focused on the academic master plan for the university, placing the academic programs of uc at the core of the strategic plan. the university invested in scholarships, funding for study abroad experiences, the university's advising program as it worked to reaffirm its history and academy for the future.  neville pinto is the current and 30th president of the university.

sustainability
in autumn of 2010, the university of cincinnati maintained its position in green and sustainability initiatives by being named one of only 286 "green colleges" by the princeton review. the university has received this distinction each year since. uc was the only public university in ohio and the only university in the southern ohio region included on this list. some of the programs that helped achieve this distinction include: a bike share program where uc students can rent bikes from the university, an expanded recycling program, improved and expanded campus transportation options, the addition of vehicle charging stations, fuel pellet use in place of coal, greatly decreased energy and water use throughout campus, and the addition of 6 leadership in energy and environmental design (leed) certified buildings since 2005. in 2007, former university president nancy zimpher signed the american college & university presidents' climate commitment, which confirms the university's dedication to reducing its environmental impact and take the necessary steps to become climate neutral.in 2010, uc opened up a privately funded athletic practice facility and women's lacrosse stadium named sheakley athletic complex. as a continued effort to go green, a chilled water thermal energy storage tank was placed under the fields and at night water is chilled and then used to air-condition buildings on campus. the storage tank helps the university reach annual energy savings of about $1 million. in the fall of 2010, the university began placing "all recycling" containers throughout campus. this expansion of recycling efforts and receptacles provides a greater opportunity for students, staff, and visitors to participate in recycling a broader range of materials. in 2010, uc recycled just over 4,600 tons of material, which was a 23 percent increase over the previous year.

co-operative education
the university of cincinnati is the originator of the co-operative education (co-op) model. the concept was invented at uc in 1906 by herman schneider, dean of the college of engineering at the time. the program generally consists of alternating semesters of coursework on campus and outside work at a host firm, giving students over one year of relevant work experience by the time they graduate. all programs in the college of engineering and applied science, architecture programs, all design programs in the college of design, architecture, art, and planning, and information technology in the college of education, criminal justice, and human services, require co-operative education experience to graduate.

university honors program

student life
housing
6,500 students live on campus in ten residence halls that offer both traditional and suite style options. students also have the option to live in themed housing, which include honors, business, and stem-specific floors. in the fall of 2012, campus recreation center housing (crc) was named on the fiscal times' list of "10 public colleges with insanely luxurious dorms". nearly 80% of uptown campus incoming freshman students live on campus their first year.in recent years, record freshman classes and increased interest by upperclass students has led to higher demand than supply for on-campus residence halls. to meet this demand, uc housing and food services has added residence halls (morgens hall in 2013) and purchased block leases at university park apartments, campus park apartments (formerly sterling manor), university edge apartments, and stetson square apartments near campus. this has pushed the "on-campus" housing student population higher. uc's largest residence hall, calhoun, was recently renovated, being finished in january 2023. neighbors to calhoun, siddall hall closed for renovation in december 2023 and is set to reopen in august 2024. uc housing & food services manages ten undergraduate residence halls.
the university also offers limited housing to graduate students. bellevue gardens is an apartment community owned and operated by the university. it is located close to the academic health center (ahc) and medical campus. two off-campus university-affiliated (but not university-managed) housing options were introduced in 2005: stratford heights and university park apartments. all leases in the stratford heights housing area have been terminated, and control of the housing complex reverted to university control as a residence hall in the summer of 2009.

programs
the center for first-year experience provides leadership for each student's first-year experience and related academic program. the center serves as a resource for all the university's undergraduate colleges and programs. the program is a collaboration between uc colleges, academic programs, and student groups and is designed to help freshmen with the transition from high school to college.learning communities are groups of about 20â€“25 students as well as faculty. students take two classes together throughout their first year on campus, based on their major or area of study. there are nearly 120 learning communities to choose from. they are offered in the following colleges: college of allied health sciences, college of business, college of education, criminal justice, and human services, college of engineering & applied sciences, college of nursing, and the college of arts & sciences. a few majors require freshmen to be in these learning communities. many of these groups have specialized courses taught by their academic advisor.the transition and access program, which does not lead to a degree, allows certain disabled adults to take classes, interact with other students, and intern at companies. after four years, participants receive a certificate of completion.the university of cincinnati was one of the first universities in the country to be classified by the carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching as a community engagement focused university and was one of only 35 research universities on this list.

student organizations

student media
there are several media outlets for university students. the student newspaper, the news record, has been in production for more than 130 years, taking its current name in 1936. it is an independent, student-run newspaper and not attached to any academic program; therefore any student, regardless of program, is able to apply and work for the newspaper. a student-run radio station named bearcast is housed in the college-conservatory of music on campus. the programming streams online as opposed to a traditional radio station and, like the news record, is open to any student attending the university. there is also a television station called ucast.

controversies
culture
in the wake of the george floyd protests in 2020, a list of demands related to racial equity at the university of cincinnati were sent to administrators by the black round table and the uc student government. demands included hiring of more black faculty, making the uc police department budget public, making election day and juneteenth university holidays, and removing charles mcmicken's name across campus, as mcmicken was a slave owner. in 2022, the university removed mcmicken's name from campus.it was noted in at least one case that these demands were "very similar to those authored by the irate 8 in 2015". the irate 8, named after the percentage of black uc students at the time, was formed following the shooting of samuel dubose by members of the ucpd in 2015. in 2019, 7% of students at the university of cincinnati identified themselves as black or african american. in comparison, the united states census bureau estimates that 42.3% of cincinnati residents are black or african american.

police and security
in 2010, kelly brinson died after being tased and restrained by ucpd inside of the university hospital. a lawsuit against the hospital was settled in august 2012.one year after brinson's death, uc student everette howard died after being tased by a uc campus police officer outside of a student dorm. reports had shown that howard was previously tased by uc police in 2009. during that incident, he had been disoriented due to dropping "weight for the wrestling team and became sick at school". following howard's death, the ucpd pulled tasers from service until further notice.in july 2015, uc police officer ray tensing shot and killed an unarmed black man, samuel dubose. three years later, tensing was paid almost $350,000 by the university of cincinnati, settling a grievance the ohio police union had filed on behalf of tensing.

sports
in 2020, former cincinnati reds owner and alumna marge schott's name was removed from the name of the uc baseball stadium, following a unanimous vote by the university's board of trustees. the vote was in response to a petition by former uc baseball player jordan ramey which garnered nearly 10,000 signatures.

internal medicine
surgery
paediatrics
orthopaedics,
obstetrics and gynecology
a choice of emergency medicine, anaesthesiology, psychiatry, family medicine;this adds up to 24 months of housemanship. they are then “fully registered” by the malaysian medical council. government service is compulsory for every medical graduate who wants full registration with the malaysian medical council—after which, they may practice independently.
sometimes the council extends the 24-month housemanship due to incompetency or health reasons. a fully registered doctor (called medical officer, mo) may choose to work in the government sector or private sector. consultants in this country, largely, refers to a doctor with completed specialty and sub-specialty training and a master or phd degree, approved by the council.

united states
a medical internship typically lasts one year and usually begins on july 1 and is officially referred to as "pgy-1" for "post-graduate year 1". internships are typically in two tracks: transitional (also known as preliminary) and categorical. a transitional internship is often undertaken at a separate hospital or institution before beginning a specialty-specific training program elsewhere. after a physician completes an internship and step 3 of the usmle or level 3 of the comlex-usa, they may practice as a general practitioner, though they are not yet board certified. however, most physicians go on to complete a specialty track residency program over two to seven years after their intern year, depending on the specialty. specialty residencies that incorporate the internship year into the program and provide all training necessary for a particular specialty are known as categorical residencies. the accreditation council for graduate medical education (acgme) officially dropped the term "intern" in 1975, instead referring to individuals in their first year of graduate medical education as "first year residents".

new facility
the original hospital, located at 1200 state street, opened in 1933. designed by the coalition of architects allied architects association, its art-deco construction earned it the nickname the "great stone mother" and had 3,000 patient beds. the 1994 northridge earthquake on january 17, 1994, renewed concerns about building safety codes, and specifically those for hospitals. the california hospital seismic safety law was signed into law on september 21, 1994. the new law took the 1200 state street building out of compliance of earthquake and fire safety codes.
to address the problem, a new modern facility was proposed and constructed nearby, at 2051 marengo street. designed by a joint venture of hok and lbl associated architects, the new $1 billion hospital consists of three linked buildings: a clinic tower, a diagnostic and treatment tower, and an inpatient tower, in total supporting 600 patient beds. the new facility has a larger number of intensive care beds to handle patients in the aftermath of disasters.

the new facility was ready by 2010, and on july 23 of that year, the new hospital was opened. transfer of all inpatients from women's and children's hospital and the 1200 state street building made the retirement of the original hospital complex official. the old building at 1200 state street still stands. the wellness center, on the first floor of the old building, was opened in 2014. it is open to the public and includes offices for nonprofit organizations, community outreach and classes for wellness activities, a dance studio, a small ymca on state street, and extensive new landscaping. while this building no longer meets the california hospital seismic safety law, it does meet current seismic standards for non-hospital use.

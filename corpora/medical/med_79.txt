the joint medical service (german: zentraler sanitätsdienst der bundeswehr, short form: zentraler sanitätsdienst, pronounced [t͡sɛnˈtʁaːlɐ zaniˈtɛːt͡sˌdiːnst] ) is a part of the bundeswehr, the armed forces of germany and serves all three armed services (army, navy and air force, as well as the cyber and information domain service). members of the central medical corps remain members of their respective military branches. only a few specialized medical units such as the medical care for divers and aircraft crews are not incorporated in the joint medical service. prior to 2002 each military branch had its own medical service. the services were then largely merged, forming the joint medical service. in may 2021 the minister of defense annegret kramp-karrenbauer together with inspector general of the bundeswehr eberhard zorn published a plan to dissolve the joint medical service and to reintegrate its units into the army, navy, airforce and cyber command.

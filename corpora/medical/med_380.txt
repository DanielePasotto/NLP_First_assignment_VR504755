replacement plan
thedacare was in the process of seeking the closure of the hospital along with thedacare regional medical center–neenah. they would have then built a brand new mega-hospital to serve the fox cities. a representative of the company stated that investing in a new hospital would make more sense than investing in the remodeling of both hospitals. the representative also said that newer medical procedures, bring the need for different facilities. thedacare cited the need for a larger intensive care unit to cope with the increased demand for beds in the unit.on october 25, 2017, it was announced that the plan was abandoned and instead they would focus on remodeling the two hospitals.

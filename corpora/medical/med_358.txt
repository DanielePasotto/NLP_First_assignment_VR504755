history
newyork-presbyterian hospital was founded in 1771 as new york hospital by edinburgh medical school graduate samuel bard. it received a royal charter granted by king george iii of great britain and became associated with weill cornell medical college upon weill cornell's founding in 1898.  it is the third oldest hospital in the united states, after bellevue hospital in new york city (1736) and pennsylvania hospital (1751).
a 1927 endowment of more than $20 million by payne whitney expanded the hospital significantly and the payne whitney psychiatric clinic is named in his honor. other prominent donors have included howard hughes, william randolph hearst, harry and leona helmsley, maurice r. greenberg, and the baker, whitney, lasdon, and payson families.
the presbyterian hospital was founded in 1868 by james lenox, a new york philanthropist and columbia university college of physicians and surgeons, also founded by samuel bard in 1767.  in 1910, columbia university and presbyterian hospital reached an agreement to affiliate, forming the world's first academic health center through the merger of existing institutions.  during the 1920s, edward s. harkness and anna harkness purchased land and funded the construction of columbia-presbyterian medical center. in 1928, the two institutions fully moved to the new medical center.in 1925, the sloane hospital for women, a leader in obstetrics and gynecology that had been founded in 1886, was incorporated. in 1928, sloan, along with the squier urological clinic and the vanderbilt clinic, moved to columbia presbyterian medical center.new york hospital was the subject of a lawsuit from the family of libby zion, a young woman admitted in 1984 who died while under the care of overworked hospital residents. an investigation by the new york state health commissioner, the bell commission, led to restrictions on the number of hours residents could work and required oversight of their care by accredited physicians (this regulation is also known as the libby zion law).  these reforms have since been adopted nationwide.newyork-presbyterian hospital, chartered as the new york and presbyterian hospital by the state of new york in 1996, was formed in 1998 with the merger of two large, previously independent hospitals, the new york hospital and presbyterian hospital. the merger had been announced on january 1, 1998.
in the 2010s, the hospital began to supplement its physical presence with remote and online services.  a telemedicine service allows patients to receive follow-up care remotely, a cat-equipped ambulance (see below nyp-ems) allows stroke care to take place outside the hospital, and a remote second opinion program uses grand rounds technology.during the initial phase covid-19 pandemic, nyp was at the center of the country's response to the virus in the spring of 2020. the hospital was able to triple its icu bed capacity and ventilator support. during the crisis, teams at nyp/columbia pioneered techniques to assist two patients with one ventilator and shared this around the country. nyp turned baker field and columbia soccer stadium into a 288-bed field hospital in under two weeks.as with many hospitals in the us, clinicians volunteered to help understaffed units. over 1,000 people volunteered at nyp including teams from university of rochester medical center, ucsf medical center, cayuga medical center, mayo clinic, cleveland clinic, university of pittsburgh medical center, uams medical center, intermountain medical center, and dartmouthâ€“hitchcock medical center. in november 2020, despite cases surged in utah, a team of 31 nurses and staff from nyp traveled to intermountain health to 'return the favor'.on october 13, 2020, with a gift from ray dalio, nyp launched the dalio center for health justice, a research and advocacy organization, which will focus on reducing differences in access to quality health care that overwhelmingly affect communities of color.

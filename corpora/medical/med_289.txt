body horror, biological horror, organic horror or visceral horror is horror fiction in which the horror is principally derived from the unnatural graphic transformation, degeneration or destruction of the physical body. such works may deal with decay, disease, deformity, parasitism, mutation or mutilation. other types of body horror include unnatural movements or the anatomically incorrect placement of limbs to create "monsters" from human body parts. david cronenberg, frank henenlotter, brian yuzna, stuart gordon, lloyd kaufman, and clive barker are notable directors of this genre. the term body horror was coined with the "body horror" theme issue of the university of glasgow film journal screen (vol. 27, no. 1, januaryâ€“february 1986), which contains several essays on the subject.

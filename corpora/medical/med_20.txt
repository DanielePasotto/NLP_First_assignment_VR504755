a medical procedure is a course of action intended to achieve a result in the delivery of healthcare.
a medical procedure with the intention of determining, measuring, or diagnosing a patient condition or parameter is also called a medical test. other common kinds of procedures are therapeutic (i.e., intended to treat, cure, or restore function or structure), such as surgical and physical rehabilitation procedures.

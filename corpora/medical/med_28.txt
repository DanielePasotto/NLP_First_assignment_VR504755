medical astrology (traditionally known as iatromathematics) is an ancient applied branch of astrology based mostly on melothesia (gr. μελοθεσία), the association of various parts of the body, diseases, and drugs with the nature of the sun, moon, planets, and the twelve astrological signs. the underlying basis for medical astrology, astrology itself, is considered to be a pseudoscience as there is no scientific basis for its core beliefs.

cornelliana
cornelliana is a term for cornell's traditions, legends, and lore. cornellian traditions include slope day, a celebration held on the last day of classes of the spring semester, and dragon day, which includes the burning of a dragon built by architecture students. dragon day is one of the school's oldest traditions and has been celebrated annually since 1901, typically on or near st. patrick's day. the dragon is built secretly by the architecture students, and taunting messages are left for the engineering students for the week before dragon day. on dragon day, the dragon is paraded across the arts quad and then set afire.according to legend, if a virgin crosses the arts quad at midnight, the statues of ezra cornell and andrew dickson white will walk off their pedestals, meet in the center of the quad, and shake hands, congratulating themselves on the chastity of students. there is also another myth that if a couple crosses the suspension bridge on north campus, and the young woman does not accept a kiss from her partner, the bridge will fall. if the kiss is accepted, the couple is assured a long future together.the university is also host to various student pranks. for example, on at least two different occasions the university has awoken to find something odd atop the 173-foot (52.7 m) tall mcgraw clock tower—once a 60-pound (27 kg) pumpkin and another time a disco ball. because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how the items were put in place remains a mystery. the colors of the lights on mcgraw tower change to orange for halloween and green for st. patrick's day. the clock tower also plays music.
the school colors are carnelian (a shade of red) and white, a play on "cornellian" and andrew dickson white. a bear is commonly used as the unofficial mascot, which dates back to the introduction of the mascot "touchdown" in 1915, a live bear who was brought onto the field during football games. the university's alma mater is "far above cayuga's waters", and its fight song is "give my regards to davy". people associated with the university are called "cornellians".

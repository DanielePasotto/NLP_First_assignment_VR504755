irish catholics (irish: caitlicigh na héireann) are an ethnoreligious group native to ireland whose members are both catholic and irish. they have a large diaspora, which includes over 36 million american citizens, plus over 7 million irish australians, of whom around 67% adhere to catholicism.

overview and history
divisions between irish roman catholics and irish protestants played a major role in the history of ireland from the 16th century to the 20th century, especially during the home rule crisis and the troubles. while religion broadly marks the delineation of these divisions, the contentions were primarily political and they were also related to access to power. for example, while the majority of irish catholics had an identity which was independent from britain's identity and were excluded from power because they were catholic, a number of the instigators of rebellions against british rule were actually protestant irish nationalists, although most irish protestants opposed separatism. in the irish rebellion of 1798, catholics and presbyterians, who were not part of the established church of ireland, found common cause.
irish catholics are found in many countries around the world, especially in the anglosphere. emigration exponentially increased due to the great famine which lasted from 1845 to 1852. in the united states, anti-irish sentiment and anti-catholicism was espoused by the know nothing movement of the 1850s and other 19th-century anti-catholic and anti-irish organizations. by the 20th century, irish catholics were well established in the united states and today they are fully-integrated into mainstream american society.

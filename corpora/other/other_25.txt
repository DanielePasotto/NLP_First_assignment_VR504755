concept
the concept for carmax was developed by circuit city executives under then-ceo richard l. sharp. it was developed for nearly a year in 1991, using the code name "project x", and was also known as "honest rick's used cars" to those intimately involved in the skunk works team. the concept was actually first proposed by ronald l. moore of richmond, virginia, a consultant hired by circuit city to evaluate possible business opportunities beyond the scope of their consumer electronics locations.
prior to the first store being built, devito/verdi was hired as the advertising agency and creative resource. the company executed the campaign and additional tv advertisements over the course of a number of years in support of the launch and the initial wave of stores.the business model began with no fees, however the model was subsequently abandoned for the current business model after it was determined that customers were not concerned about paying transaction fees for the purchase of a vehicle.
a typical carmax store is approximately 59,000 square feet (5,500 m2), carries an inventory of 300â€“400 vehicles, and turns its inventory over eight to ten times a year. on average, a carmax location employs 40 sales associates. each car goes through a thorough 125-point inspection process, beyond any state-required inspections, and includes a 90-day warranty, three days to change the financing for free, and a 30-day money back guarantee.circuit city issued the first carmax stock in february 1997, when carmax had seven locations. initially, the stock was a tracking stock still under the umbrella of circuit city. carmax officially split from circuit city as of october 1, 2002, when it was spun off as a stock dividend for circuit city shareholders, with shares also issued to those holding carmax tracking stock.carmax sold over 750,000 vehicles to consumers in fiscal year 2021 (march 1, 2020 - february 28, 2021).  according to the carmax fiscal year 2018 report released on april 24, 2018, the company opened 15 used car superstores in fiscal year 2018, and expects to open 15 additional stores in fiscal year 2019.

competition
while carmax is seen as the nation's largest used-car retailer, it is not without competition.  with a large shift in customer shopping habits, more online-only companies have worked to eat away at its market share in the used vehicle market.  to combat this carmax unveiled what it calls their omni-channel platform, which is aimed at allowing customer to buy a car online, in-store, or any combination of the two. they also have provided opportunities for customers to choose vehicle delivery at their home, contactless curbside pickup, and more. these offerings directly compete with other home delivery based options such as carvana, vroom, shift technologies, and others.

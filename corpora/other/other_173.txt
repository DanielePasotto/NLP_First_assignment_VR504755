the global partnership on artificial intelligence (gpai, pronounced "gee-pay") is an international initiative established to guide the responsible development and use of artificial intelligence (ai) in a manner that respects human rights and the shared democratic values of its members. the partnership was first proposed by canada and france at the 2018 44th g7 summit, and officially launched in june 2020. gpai is hosted by the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd).
gpai seeks to bridge the gap between theory and practice by supporting research and applied activities in areas that are directly relevant to policymakers in the realm of ai. it brings together experts from industry, civil society, governments, and academia to collaborate on the challenges and opportunities presented by artificial intelligence.

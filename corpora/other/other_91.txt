executive car is a british term for a large car which is equivalent to the european e-segment and american full-size classifications. executive cars are larger than compact executive cars (and the non-luxury equivalent mid-size cars), and smaller than luxury saloons / full-size luxury sedans.
the term has also been adopted by euro ncap, a european organization founded to test for car safety.

background
the term was coined in the 1960s to describe cars targeted at successful professionals and middle-to-senior managers. it was used by businesses as an incentive for employees in senior roles and to exploit britain and europe's tax schemes as a company owned vehicle. early executive cars typically offered engines with displacements of 2.0–3.5 l (122–214 cu in), compared with 1.6–2.4 l (98–146 cu in) for an equivalent sized—but less luxurious—"large family car".prior to the 1990s, executive cars were typically sedans, however in recent years they have also been produced in other body styles, such as estates (station wagons), convertibles, coupés, and five-door hatch versions. they typically need to be "comfortable, refined and display some form of driving pleasure" on occasion.

body styles
in general, executive cars are 4-door saloons, though may include estate, 5-door hatchback or 2-door coupé variants. rover, saab, renault and citroën formerly have been known to prefer variants to sedans, with ford also offering alternatives through the 1990s. audi, bmw and later mercedes-amg have recently offered such body styles as options for their executive cars since 2010s.

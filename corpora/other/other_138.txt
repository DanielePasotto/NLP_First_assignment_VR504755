the association for the advancement of artificial intelligence (aaai) is an international scientific society devoted to promote research in, and responsible use of, artificial intelligence. aaai also aims to increase public understanding of artificial intelligence (ai), improve the teaching and training of ai practitioners, and provide guidance for research planners and funders concerning the importance and potential of current ai developments and future directions.

history

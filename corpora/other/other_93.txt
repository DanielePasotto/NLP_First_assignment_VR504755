carplay, or apple carplay is an apple standard that enables a car radio or head unit to be a display and controller for an ios device. it is available on iphone 5 and later models running ios 7.1 or later.
more than 800 car models come with support for carplay, according to apple. vehicle owners can add support by installing certain aftermarket vehicle audio products.most carplay-equipped vehicles connect to ios devices through a usb connection, while some also allow devices to connect through a wireless connection. wireless support can also be added through aftermarket dongles.

software
apple's carplay-enabled apps include: 

phone
apple music
apple maps
calendar
messages
audiobooks (part of apple books)
podcasts
settings
newsdevelopers must obtain permission from apple to develop carplay-enabled apps. such apps fall into five categories:  

audio: primarily provide audio content, such as music or podcasts. examples: amazon music, audible, google play music, iheartradio, qq music, spotify, and overcast.
navigation: turn-by-turn guidance, including searching for points of interests and navigating to a destination. examples: autonavi, baidu maps, google maps, and waze.
automaker-made apps allow a user to control vehicle-specific features such as climate controls, gas levels, or radio via carplay.
messaging/voice over ip (voip): listen to new messages and reply using dictation in an audio-only interface. messaging apps on carplay integrate with third-party siri support (known as sirikit), while voip apps integrate with the ios calling interface using callkit. examples: telegram, whatsapp, and zoom.
food-ordering and parking-services apps.to discourage distracted driving, siri is used extensively, providing voice turn-by-turn navigation guidance and voice-input for text messages. newscast-style weather and stock results are announced instead of displayed visually. requests that bring up visual information may be blocked when the car is in drive; most native carplay apps deliver audio content with minimal interaction. 
carplay-enabled apps installed on the device appear on the carplay home screen.

hardware
while most of the carplay software runs on the connected iphone, the carplay interface provides the audio and display connection to the car's infotainment system. carplay adapts to various display sizes and control interfaces for each vehicle: touch screen, rotary dials, buttons, steering-wheel controls, and hands-free microphones. 
aftermarket head units may support carplay and/or android auto. aftermarket head units can be purchased from alpine, clarion, kenwood, pioneer, sony and jvc.the iphone can connect to the car through a usb cable or wirelessly in two ways: by exchanging network credentials with a supporting carplay receiver over bluetooth, establishing a two-way wi-fi connection; or by using a dongle adapter to enable a wireless connection to the system's usb port.

manufacturers
most major automakers offer vehicles with carplay. manufacturers with no carplay models include wuling, rivian and tesla motors.honda offers carplay on the gold wing motorcycle and on the africa twin.

history
predecessor
by 2008, a year after iphone introduction [2009 model year for america], mercedes vehicles were first to sell an audio system incorporating both the [ipod and iphone] and were equipped with 30-pin ios input jacks. the new 2008 harman kardon ntg 2.5 featured full audio streaming, syncing, charging and control integrated into the steering wheel controls, instrument panel and head unit. apple was working with mercedes to develop ios compatible audio systems into their cars first only a year after iphone launch. with an apple lightning-to-30-pin adapter, iphones/ipods remain backwards-compatible with the harman kardon 2.5 and later models. this is the earliest audio system specifically engineered for ipod/iphone integration, which predated carplay and every other manufacturer incorporating ios into vehicles.the concept of carplay was based on the ios 4 feature called "ipod out" which was produced through several years of joint development by apple and the bmw group's technology office usa. ipod out enabled vehicles with the necessary infrastructure to "host" the analog video and audio from a supporting ios device while receiving inputs, such as button presses and knob rotations, from a car's infotainment system, to drive the "hosted" user interface in the vehicle's built-in display. it was announced at wwdc 2010 and first shipped in bmw group vehicles in early 2011. the bmw and mini option was called "plugin" and paved the way for the first cross-oem platforms, introducing the concept of requiring a car-specific interface for apps (as opposed to mirrorlink's simple and insufficient mirroring of what was shown on the smartphone's screen).

development
carplay's codename was stark. apple's eddy cue announced it as ios in the car at wwdc 2013. in january 2014 it was reported that apple's hardware-oriented corporate culture had led to release delays. ios in the car was then rebranded and launched as "carplay" with significant design changes at the geneva motor show in march 2014 with ferrari, kia, mercedes-benz, and volvo among the first car manufacturers.at wwdc 2022, apple introduced an all-new version of carplay (informally known as carplay 2) which can control vehicle functions, access vehicle stats and take over multiple vehicle screens completely. the projected release date from apple for this new carplay is late 2023. manufacturers that are planning to adopt the new carplay include: audi, acura, ford, honda, infiniti, jaguar, land rover, lincoln, mercedes-benz, nissan, polestar, porsche, renault and volvo.

competition
the open automotive alliance's android auto is a similar implementation used for android devices.
some vehicle manufacturers have their own systems for syncing the car with smartphones, for example: bmw connecteddrive,  nissanconnect, hyundai blue link, ilane, myford touch, ford sync, onstar, and toyota entune.
general motors has released an api to allow the development of apps which interact with vehicle software systems.mirrorlink is a standard for car-smartphone connectivity, currently implemented in vehicles by honda, volkswagen, seat, buick, skoda, mercedes-benz, citroÃ«n, and smart with phones by manufacturers including apple, htc, samsung, and sony.

phaseout by general motors
in april 2023, general motors announced that it would gradually stop including apple carplay and android auto in its electric vehicles so that it could collect and monetize more driver data and deliver a better user experience. for instance, gm executive scott miller said, company-made software could warm up the electric automobile's battery before driving, something apple software cannot do. the company said drivers would still be able to connect smartphones to their car with bluetooth. 
the announcement was widely panned by consumers; the detroit free press reported that some longtime gm customers said the lack of carplay would lead them to look at buying a ford vehicle instead. the move was widely interpreted by the press as promoting its partnership with google and cutting off revenue streams to apple at the expense of its customers. some noted that the move would severely inhibit customers' data privacy.ford, a gm rival, announced that its vehicles would continue to offer carplay. ford noted that gm's announcement meant that ford's inclusion of carplay further distinguished itself among ev manufacturers because tesla and rivian have historically not included carplay.

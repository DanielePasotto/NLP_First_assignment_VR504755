in geography, a bight () is a concave bend or curvature in a coastline, river or other geographical feature, or it may refer to a very open bay formed by such a feature.  such bays are typically broad, open, shallow and only slightly recessed.

description
bights are distinguished from sounds, in that sounds are much deeper. traditionally, explorers defined a bight as a bay that could be sailed out of on a single tack in a square-rigged sailing vessel, regardless of the direction of the wind (typically meaning the apex of the bight is less than 25 degrees from the edges).
the term is derived from old english byht ("bend, angle, corner; bay, bight") with german bucht and danish bugt as cognates, both meaning "bay". bight is not etymologically related to "bite" (old english bÄ«tan).

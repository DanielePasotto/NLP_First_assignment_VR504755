climate and climate change
suriname has a tropical rainforest climate and a tropical monsoon climate, with hot humid conditions year-round.
climate change  in both suriname and the wider world is leading to hotter temperatures and more extreme weather. as a fairly poor country, its contributions to global climate change have been limited. suriname has a large forest cover, the country has been running a carbon negative economy since 2014. hotter temperatures and changes in precipitation trends are predicted because of climate change.

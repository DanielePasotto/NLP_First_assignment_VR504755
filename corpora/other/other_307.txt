the terms liberal catholic church (lcc) and liberal catholic movement are used by a number of separate independent catholic denominations throughout the world descending from bishop james i. wedgwood.although the term liberal catholic might suggest otherwise, it does not refer to liberal groups within the roman catholic church, but to groups unrecognised by and not in communion with the holy see.

history
foundation
wedgwood claims he established the liberal catholic church. wedgwood also says that during the existence of the early unified liberal catholic church, he created the liberal rite. following accusations of sexual misconduct with juveniles, in 1919, wedgwood resigned from the theosophical society and the liberal catholic church.

young rite
in 2006, former lcc presiding bishop johannes van alphen consecrated markus van alphen. alphen, in turn, established the young rite. bishop johannes himself eventually joined the young rite, serving there until his death. among the tenets of the young rite was the belief that all possessed a path to the priesthood, and anyone requesting ordination should receive it. this practice was abandoned in the united states after markus van alphen's retirement and with the establishment of the community of saint george, a young rite jurisdiction. young rite usa now requires a multi-year formation program for its clergy.

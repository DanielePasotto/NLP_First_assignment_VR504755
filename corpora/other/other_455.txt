storyline
carnivores is set in the year 2190. during an exploration mission in unknown space, a science vessel known as fmm uv stumbled upon a planet with a climate similar to that of earth, making it suitable for life. the new planet was code-named fmm uv-32. during the initial scouting expedition, the planet was declared inhospitable for colonization due to its unstable terrain and an unexpected abundant population of extraterrestrial organisms that resemble dinosaurs and other prehistoric reptiles. news articles about fmm uv-32 led an earth corporation to purchase the rights to the planet and to create dinohunt corporation, which allowed customers to hunt the planet's dinosaurs.

reception
the game received mixed reviews according to the review aggregation website gamerankings. trent c. ward of ign praised its dinosaur and environment sounds, but believed that the game was "too damn easy," stating that it was "a surprisingly entertaining game that just doesn't have enough options to keep players busy for the long term." greg kasavin of gamespot praised its sound effects, and its levels for looking "surprisingly authentic," but noted that the game is "tantalizing yet not quite complete to be entirely satisfying."tom chick of computer gaming world praised the dinosaurs and environments, but stated that the game can be a little tedious for players who are not into hunting games, although he noted that "this is clearly a game about stalking rather than action". don st. jon of gamepro was disappointed by carnivores as an action game, but stated that it was a "mildly pleasant surprise" as a hunting game. jon stated that the game showed "its budget status in some ways" such as the minimal weapon and level choices, as well as the repetitive appearance of the environments, but he concluded that the game's action elements "take it a notch above most hunting titles". gamerevolution praised the realistic appearance and behavior of the game's dinosaurs, as well as the large environments and the graphics, but criticized the game for "long periods of boredom and tedium".andrew s. bub of computer games strategy plus noted that the game's story was "weak and more than a bit silly," but he praised its graphics, sound, and the "challenging and surprisingly fun" gameplay. michael l. house of allgame praised the graphics and the lack of music, writing, "ambient sounds definitely let you feel as if you've arrived in a prehistoric landscape." house also praised the limited amount of ammunition available on each hunt, stating that it made the game "much more grounded in fact â€“ it just doesn't offer a chance for the undisciplined trigger-happy hunter to blast away at anything that moves without ever running out of ammunition."

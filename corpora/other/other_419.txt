plot
a theatrically-minded pet chameleon becomes stranded in the mojave desert of nevada after his terrarium accidentally falls out of his owners' car. seeking shelter, he learns from a nine-banded armadillo named roadkill, who is seeking the mystical "spirit of the west", and tells the chameleon of an old west desert town called dirt, where water comes in through a mysterious rite on wednesdays.
seeing no other options, the chameleon heads out into the desert. there, he narrowly avoids being eaten by a vicious red-tailed hawk before meeting beans, a desert iguana rancher, who takes him to dirt.
asked about his identity, the chameleon presents himself to the townsfolk as a tough drifter named "rango" and quickly runs afoul of gila monster bad bill, who challenges him to a duel. the hawk interrupts the duel and chases rango, who accidentally knocks over an empty water tower and crushes the hawk to death. believing he did so intentionally, the townsfolk praise rango, who is appointed as the new sheriff by dirt's desert tortoise mayor john. meanwhile, the townsfolk worry that with the hawk dead, the infamous gunslinger rattlesnake jake will return.
with the town desperate for water during a drought, beans demands that rango investigates where the water has gone and in doing so, he inadvertently helps a gang of bank robbers, led by a mole named balthazar, to steal the water supply. rango organizes a posse that later finds the banker, mr. merrimack, dead in the middle of the desert. the posse tracks the robbers to their hideout, where they fight balthazar's bat-riding clan over the stolen water bottle before discovering it to be empty. the robbers profess that they found it like that, but rango still takes them into custody.
after being questioned by rango about his buying of the land around dirt, john brings in rattlesnake jake, who runs him out of town after forcing him to admit his lies to the townsfolk. dejected, rango returns to the highway, where he passes out after he crosses to the other side. he eventually meets the spirit of the west, an elderly man with no name, who advises him to go back to dirt and set things right, telling him that "no man can walk out on his own story".
with the aid of roadkill and mystical moving yuccas, rango discovers an emergency shut-off valve in a water pipeline to las vegas. john has been manipulating it to cause the water shortage so he could buy the land for himself.
with a single bullet, rango returns to dirt and challenges jake to a duel, a diversion to allow the yuccas to restore the town's water and rango to make his resolve clear to jake. however, john and his men force rango to surrender by threatening beans' life before attempting to drown the duo inside the bank's vault.
john then tries to shoot jake with rango's gun – believing that both he and rango represent too much of the old traditions – but finds rango has taken the sole bullet, which he uses to shatter the vault's glass door, freeing himself and beans. impressed, jake salutes rango for proving his heroism before carrying john off into the desert to kill him. the citizens of dirt celebrate the return of their water supply, and rango, now a true hero.

production
the filming was described as "emotion capture" as the actors shot their scenes in live action for the animators to use as reference. during production, the actors and actresses received costumes and sets in order to "give them the feel of the wild west". star johnny depp had 20 days in which to voice rango, and the filmmakers scheduled the supporting actors to interact with him. verbinski said his attempt with rango was to do a "small" film after the first three large-scale pirates of the caribbean movies, but that he underestimated how painstaking, time-consuming and expensive animated filmmaking is.  paramount stepped in at the last possible minute as verbinski's slim financing was about to run out.unlike many studio animation projects produced since avatar, rango was rendered in 2d, not 3d, as the budget would not allow for it and verbinski did not want to do a "half-assed 3d".the film contains a number of references to movie westerns and other films, including the shakiest gun in the west, a fistful of dollars, chinatown, the good, the bad and the ugly, once upon a time in the west, cat ballou, raising arizona, and fear and loathing in las vegas; as well as references to earlier ilm work including the dogfight in the death star trench in star wars episode iv: a new hope. verbinski has also cited el topo as an influence on the film.in a discussion about the nature of contemporary animated features, verbinski said in december 2011:

there are shackles with the budgets and the profit margins. you want to compete with what they're doing at pixar and dreamworks. there's a price tag with that just in terms of achieving that quality level. what happened to the ralph bakshis of the world? we're all sitting here talking about family entertainment. does animation have to be family entertainment? i think at that cost, yes. there's the bull's-eye you have to hit, but when you miss it by a little bit and you do something interesting, the bull's-eye is going to move. audiences want something new; they just can't articulate what.

[but] more like a succession of picturesque notions that might have flowed from dreamworks or pixar while their story departments were out to lunch."in one of the more negative reviews, michael phillips of the chicago tribune acknowledged its "considerable care and craft" but called it "completely soulless" and that watching it "with a big suburban preview audience was instructive. not much laughter. moans and sobs of pre-teen fright whenever rattlesnake jake slithered into view, threatening murder."

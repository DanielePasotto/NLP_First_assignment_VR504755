basilicas are catholic church buildings that have a designation, conferring special privileges, given by the pope. basilicas are distinguished for ceremonial purposes from other churches. the building need not be a basilica in the architectural sense (a rectangular building with a central nave flanked by two or more longitudinal aisles). basilicas are either major basilicas, of which there are four, all in the diocese of rome, or minor basilicas, of which there were 1,810 worldwide as of 2019.numerous basilicas are notable shrines, often even receiving significant pilgrimages, especially among the many that were built above a confessio or the burial place of a martyr; although this term now usually designates a space before the high altar that is sunk lower than the main floor level (as in the case in st peter's and st john lateran in rome) and that offer more immediate access to the burial places below. some catholic basilicas are catholic pilgrimage sites, receiving tens of millions of visitors per year.churches designated as papal basilicas, in particular, possess a papal throne and a papal high altar, at which no one may celebrate mass without the pope's permission.

ranking of churches
the papal or major basilicas outrank in precedence all other churches. other rankings put the cathedral (or co-cathedral) of a bishop ahead of all other churches in the same diocese, even if they have the title of minor basilica. if the cathedral is that of a suffragan diocese, it yields precedence to the cathedral of the  metropolitan see. the cathedral of a primate is considered to rank higher than that of other metropolitan(s) in his circumscription (usually a present or historical state). other classifications of churches include  collegiate churches, which may or may not also be minor basilicas. 
the distinction between major basilicas and minor basilicas appears to have arisen in the early 18th century. the earliest document that records the use of the term major basilica dates from 1727.

major and papal basilicas
to the category "major basilica" belong only the four great churches of rome, which among other distinctions have a special holy door and to which a visit is always prescribed as one of the conditions for gaining the roman jubilee. only the major basilicas may prefix their titles with the adjective sacrosancta (most holy).
st. john lateran, also called the lateran basilica. since it is the cathedral of the diocese of rome, in the tradition of the catholic church, it has claims as the mother church of the world. for this reason, st john lateran is the only church that is also known as an "archbasilica".
st. peter's basilica, also called the vatican basilica, is a major pilgrimage site, built over the burial place of peter the apostle.
st. paul outside the walls, also known as the ostian basilica because it is situated on the road that led to ostia, is built over the burial place of paul the apostle.
st. mary major, also called the liberian basilica because the original building (not the present one) was attributed to pope liberius, is the largest church in rome dedicated to the virgin mary.the four major basilicas, together with the minor basilica of st lawrence outside-the-walls, were formerly known as "patriarchal basilicas" as they were associated with the five ancient patriarchal sees of christendom (see pentarchy). upon relinquishing the title of patriarch of the west in 2006, pope benedict xvi renamed these basilicas from "patriarchal basilicas" to "papal basilicas". 

st. john lateran was associated with the pope, the bishop of rome and the patriarch of the west.
st. peter's basilica was associated with the patriarch of constantinople.
st. paul outside the walls was associated with the patriarch of alexandria.
st. mary major was associated with the patriarch of antioch.
st. lawrence outside the walls was associated with the patriarch of jerusalem.nominally, the respective patriarchs could avail of accommodation attached to the basilicas should they have business in rome. these assignments, however, are now purely historical. in some cases, more than one patriarch holds the title for the same patriarchate. for example, each of the catholic patriarchs of the melkite, maronite and syrian rites holds the title of "patriarch of antioch".

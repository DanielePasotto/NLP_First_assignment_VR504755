in geography, a cape is a headland, or peninsula or promontory extending into a body of water, usually the sea. a cape usually represents a marked change in trend of the coastline, often making them important landmarks in sea navigation. this also makes them prone to natural forms of erosion, mainly tidal actions, resulting in a relatively short geological lifespan. capes can be formed by glaciers, volcanoes, and changes in sea level. erosion plays a large role in each of these methods of formation.

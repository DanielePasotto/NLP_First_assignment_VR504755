background
according to warp co-founder steve beckett, the album was primarily intended for sedentary listening rather than dancing, and this was reflected in the album art, which depicts an android asleep in an armchair with kraftwerk and pink floyd albums autobahn (1974) and the dark side of the moon (1973), respectively, at its side:

you could sit down and listen to it like you would a kraftwerk or pink floyd album. that's why we put those sleeves on the cover of artificial intelligence â€“ to get it into people's minds that you weren't supposed to dance to it!
the third album on the floor is pioneers of the hypnotic groove collection (warp,1991).

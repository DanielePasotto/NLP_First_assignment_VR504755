history
in 1871 the zürich catholic community planned to build a church to commemorate the 1270s augustinian abbey church. as the whole community was excommunicated from the catholic church for refusing to accept the first vatican council, the augustinerkirche at the münzplatz became its present parish church. ferdinand stadler (1813–1870), an architect born in zürich, was charged with the construction of a new church building.in february 2000, denise wyss was ordained within the christian catholic church of switzerland, as the first female old catholic priest of switzerland.between 1970 and 1990, the membership of the christian catholic church decreased from 20,268 to only 11,748 members. data from the last censuses show that the aging of the population is a much greater problem for the christian catholic church than for the other national churches. however, contrary to the trend of church departures from the two large national churches, the christian catholic church has again recorded a constant increase in membership since 1990. between 1990 and 2000, the number of members grew by over 13% from 11,748 to 13,312.in 2009, bishop harald rein was elected as the head of the church. prior to this, he served as a parish priest and as vicar general of the church. on september 12, 2009, he was consecrated in zurich by archbishop joris vercammen of utrecht. in august 2020, same-sex marriages were allowed in christian catholic church of switzerland.

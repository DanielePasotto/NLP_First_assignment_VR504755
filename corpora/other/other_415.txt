development
conception
in july 2017, the australian broadcasting corporation (abc) and the british broadcasting corporation (bbc) co-commissioned bluey as an animated series for preschool children to be developed by queensland production company ludo studio. the production received funding from screen australia and screen queensland, with the setting of the series drawing upon the unique semi-tropical queensland climate. created by joe brumm, the series was inspired by his experience in raising two daughters. brumm wanted to portray the importance of children participating in imaginative play, creating the title character bluey as a cattle dog to give the series an australian voice. brumm had previously worked on children's programs in the united kingdom as a freelance animator and decided to create bluey as a replica of the program peppa pig for an australian audience. he conceived the idea independently in 2016, and produced a one-minute pilot through his company studio joho, with a small team in their spare time. brumm approached ludo studio to develop the series; co-founders charlie aspinwall and daley pearson pitched the pilot at conferences such as mipcom in france. brumm stated that the first pilot contained some "dangerous" character behaviours which drew the attention of studio executives; this included bandit pushing bluey on a swing in an unsafe way. pearson expressed that it was difficult to pitch the series as it was not high-concept; but rather "just a show about family and games".the studio developed a five-minute animation sample that was pitched at the asian animation summit in brisbane in 2016, and was thereby noticed by abc and bbc executives. michael carrington of the abc viewed the presentation and secured $20,000 of funding for the studio to produce a refined, seven-minute pilot. the new pilot was presented at the asian animation summit in 2017. the two networks officially ordered 52 seven-minute episodes of bluey, with the bbc investing 30 percent of the funding and acquiring the global rights for distribution and merchandising. the series was produced entirely in australia by a local team, many of whom were first-time animators from brisbane. the program was announced to premiere in australia on abc kids, followed by cbeebies.

production
writing
the stories featured in bluey depict bluey and bingo engaging in imaginative play. brumm wanted to show that self-directed and unstructured play is natural in shaping children and allowing them to develop. he consulted research based on socio-dramatic play, reading the works of sara smilansky and vivian paley, who both had backgrounds in early childhood education. the episodes show the parents as guides for their children, who allow them to explore their immediate surroundings independently, giving them opportunities to practise adult roles. brumm drew inspiration for scripts from his own experiences in watching his daughters play, which he described was "as natural to them as breathing". the program's scripts show how children can use gameplay to learn lessons and integrate the world of adults into their own; brumm noticed how his children would recreate interactions such as visits to the doctor, through roleplay. pearson stated that gameplay represents children's first experiences of collaboration, cooperation, responsibility and emotions such as jealousy. brumm discovered the importance of play-based learning after his daughter struggled with formal education, which led him to exclude elements of literacy and numeracy in bluey and focus on the depiction of life skills. brumm stated that he wanted the series to depict his experience as a parent rather than aim for children to be explicitly taught something. his creative aims were to make children laugh, and show parents what children can learn while engaged in play.the characters of bluey each represent a particular dog breed, some of which are drawn from brumm's personal life. brumm had a blue heeler named bluey throughout his childhood, in addition to a dalmatian named chloe and an australian red kelpie named rusty, who brumm initially based the show on in early development. bandit is based on a blue heeler belonging to his father's friend. bandit's career as an archaeologist was inspired by brumm's older sibling adam.brumm writes the majority of episode scripts, with aspinwall labelling the series as an "observational" show, depicting brumm's family life, and producer sam moor describing it as "[brumm's] life on screen"; when producing the pilot, brumm's daughters were aged between four and six, like bluey and bingo. brumm's process for writing sometimes begins with making notes about his family's experiences; including games his children play and the conflict that arises between them. for this reason, brumm has described the process as a challenge for other writers on the series. moor stated that there are few writers besides brumm, mostly animators already working on the series. the program was designed to be a co-viewing experience for parents and their children to enjoy together. brumm described the process of writing each episode as "a chance to make a short film". the conflict and humour in the episodes stems from bandit's relationship with his daughters. bluey has been described as "rough and tumble" by pearson, with both her and bingo being seen to subvert the stereotypes of female characters, but rather have the characteristics of real puppies. this has led to uninformed viewers questioning if the characters are boys or girls. pearson has credited the decision of bluey and bingo being girls to resemble the real families of brumm, aspinwall and mccormack. in relation to the humour of the series, brumm has stated there is a lot of physical activity and "craziness".

storyboarding and animation
bluey is animated in-house at ludo studio in brisbane, in fortitude valley, where approximately 50 people work on the program. costa kassab serves as one of the art directors of the series, who has been credited with drawing the locations of the series which are based on real places in brisbane, including parks and shopping centres. locations featured in the series have included queen street mall and south bank, as well as landmarks such as the big pelican on the noosa river. brumm determines the specific locations which are to be included. post-production of the series takes place externally in south brisbane.approximately fifteen episodes of the series are developed by the studio at any one time across a range of production stages. after story ideas are conceived, the script-writing process takes place for up to two months. the episodes are then storyboarded by artists, who produce 500 to 800 drawings over three weeks while consulting the writer's script. after the storyboard is finished, a black and white animatic is produced, to which the dialogue recorded independently by voice artists is added. the episodes are then worked on for four weeks by animators, background artists, designers, and layout teams. the entire production team views a near-completed episode of bluey on a friday. pearson stated that over time, the viewings developed into test screenings where members of production would bring their family, friends and children to watch the episode. the complete production process for an episode takes three to four months. moor described the program's colour palette as "a vibrant pastel".during the lockdown period of the covid-19 pandemic, the production staff of 50 were required to work on the episodes remotely from home. a skeleton crew of three remained working on the series at the studio. after restrictions eased in may, this number increased to ten and later 20.

casting
the series features david mccormack, from the band custard, as the voice of bluey's father, bandit. he was initially approached to read what he assumed would only be "a couple of lines", but ended up voicing bandit for the entire pilot. mccormack performs his voice work for the series remotely in sydney, which is then sent to the production company in brisbane. he stated that he does not hear any other voice actors or view footage while recording, and that he does not alter his own voice to produce bandit's dialogue. melanie zanetti provides the voice of bluey's mother, chilli; she became interested in the series after reading the script for the pilot.brumm's mother, chris brumm, voices nana heeler, while his younger brother, dan brumm, voices uncle stripe, as well as working as a sound designer on the series. the child characters of the series, including bluey and bingo, are voiced by some of the children of the program's production crew.

music
joff bush serves as the primary composer of bluey, writing half of the soundtrack himself and leading a group of additional composers, including david barber. bush graduated from the queensland conservatorium, where he met pearson, and before bluey worked on series such as the family law and australian survivor. bush has stated that each episode has its own unique musical style, and he likes to become involved in the episodes as they are scripted. live instruments are regularly played for the recordings. every episode of bluey is individually scored, a decision made by brumm, who was inspired by the original compositions for charlie and lola while working on the series in the united kingdom. classical music is regularly used throughout the underscore, with pieces such as beethoven's "ode to joy" and mozart's "rondo alla turca (from sonata no. 11)" being interpreted by composers. a movement from the planets by gustav holst is prominently featured in the episode "sleepytime".bush composed the theme song for bluey, and he has been nominated for several apra screen music awards, in 2019 for the soundtrack of the episode "teasing" and in 2020 for "flat pack". he was nominated for the apra award for most performed screen composer – overseas in 2022, and won the award in 2023. the show's score won best music for children's programming in 2021. the music for bluey is licensed by universal music publishing on behalf of bbc worldwide music publishing. the first soundtrack for the series by bush, bluey: the album, was released on 22 january 2021. it debuted at number one on the aria albums chart, and became the first children's album to reach the top of the charts in australia. it won best children's album at the 2021 aria music awards, and won the 2021 apra award for best soundtrack album. a second soundtrack, dance mode!, was released on 21 april 2023.

future
production on the third series concluded in april 2022. in july 2023, pearson stated that the production team were taking a short break from making episodes. he denied that the program would end after the third series, but explained that there were no immediate plans for a fourth series. a collection of shorts were produced before the break in production.

themes
a central theme of the series is the influence of a supportive family; this is reflected in the relationships between bluey, bingo, bandit and chilli. the heeler family are presented as a nuclear family. brumm was eager to reflect contemporary parenting practices, with both adults shown to be working parents; bandit as an archaeologist and chilli working part-time in airport security. bethany hiatt of the west australian explains that the series depicts the realities of modern-day fatherhood, with bandit seen regularly doing housework and engaging in imaginative play with his children. chilli's role as a mother is explored as she balances both work and family life. her struggles with newborn motherhood and encounters of competitiveness in a parenting group are depicted through flashbacks of bluey experiencing significant developmental milestones. both parents are shown to acknowledge and validate the emotions of their children, such as bluey's distress after the death of a bird. bluey and bingo are shown to navigate their sibling relationship throughout the episodes, learning how to work together, compromise, and resolve conflicts. episodes detail the family's contemporary domestic lifestyle, with philippa chandler of the guardian describing the series as "social realism".
the series also depicts australian contemporary culture, and is set in semi-tropical queensland. the animation of australian architecture in the series is designed to reflect the typical queenslander residential designs of brisbane; high-set suburban dwellings with characteristic verandas, against representations of brisbane skylines. the characters speak with australian accents in local and international airings. the series has a focus on the australian sense of humour with dry wit frequently expressed through the dialogue. several episodes detail the exploration of australia's climate and nature, with characters encountering australian wildlife such as fruit bats, wallabies, kookaburras and ibises. flora of australia are also depicted in the series, including poinciana trees and jacaranda trees. the series explores australian sport through the inclusion of rugby league; the maroons and the blues are featured in a depiction of the state of origin series. however, brumm has expressed that he did not want to exaggerate the stereotypes of australia.the series advocates the importance of play throughout childhood. bluey and bingo are the vehicle used to display this theme; the episode "trampoline" features bandit imploring bluey to continue creating new games to play. the siblings engage in imaginative play during "mundane" activities such as visiting the doctor or going to the supermarket. the parents are shown to engage in the play with their children. bluey and bingo also engage in imaginative play with their friends; learning lessons such as the importance of following the rules. the characters also learn lessons such as the influence of technology, the economy and personal finance through their gameplay. pearson has stated that the characters experience emotions such as jealousy and regret through their gameplay. he commented that, while there is no antagonist in the series, these emotions form the central conflicts of the program.the character of jack is shown to have attention deficit issues; he states that he "can't sit still or remember anything". upon the online character announcement, parents praised the representation of children with attention deficit issues. dougie was introduced as a profoundly deaf character who uses auslan to communicate with his mother in the episode "turtleboy"; the character is shown signing but it is not the focus of the episode's story. consultants were involved to authentically animate the auslan signs, and viewers praised the representation. the episode "onesies" alludes to the fact that chilli's sister brandy cannot have children, addressing the topic of fertility without specifically labelling the reason why. it was also reported that "the show" subtly approaches pregnancy loss.

senegal is a coastal west african nation located 14 degrees north of the equator and 14 degrees west of the prime meridian. the country's total area is 196,190 km2 of which 192,000 km2 is land and 4,190 km2 is water.
70% of the population of senegal lives in the coastal region. because most of senegal's population is on the coast, climate change is expected to displace larger parts of the population.

physical features
senegal is bordered to the west by the north atlantic ocean. on land, the nation's longest border is with mauritania to the north, an 813 km border along the senegal river. to the east is the 419 km border with mali. in the southeast is guinea (330 km border) and to the south-southwest is guinea-bissau (338 km), both borders running along the casamance river. senegal is one of only a handful of countries to have a near-enclave within its borders—the small nation of the gambia in the interior, which has a 740 km border with senegal.
the gambia penetrates more than 320 km into senegal, from the atlantic coast to the center of senegal along the gambia river, which bisects senegal's territory. in total, senegal has 2,640 km of land borders, and 531 km of coastline and shoreline. senegal makes maritime claims of a 24 nmi (44.4 km; 27.6 mi) contiguous zone, a 12 nmi (22.2 km; 13.8 mi) territorial sea, and a 370 km (200 nmi; 230 mi) exclusive economic zone. it also claims a 200 nmi (370.4 km; 230.2 mi) continental shelf, or to the edge of the continental margin.
another distinctive and well-known feature of the country is the pink-water lake retba, near the city of dakar, which is one of the few lakes in the world with naturally pink or reddish coloured water.
the lowest point in senegal is the atlantic ocean, at sea level. the highest point is baunez ridge situated 2.7 km southeast of nepen diakha at 648 m (2,126 ft).

climate
tropical; hot, humid; rainy season (may to november) has strong southeast winds; dry season (december to april) dominated by hot, dry, harmattan wind.
well-defined dry and humid seasons result from northeast winter winds and southwest summer winds. dakar's annual rainfall of about 600 mm (24 in) occurs between june and october when maximum temperatures average 30 °c (86.0 °f) and minimums 24.2 °c (75.6 °f); december to february maximum temperatures average 25.7 °c (78.3 °f) and minimums 18 °c (64.4 °f).interior temperatures are higher than along the coast (for example, average daily temperatures in kaolack and tambacounda for may are 30 °c (86.0 °f) and 32.7 °c (90.9 °f) respectively, compared to dakar's 23.2 °c (73.8 °f) ), and rainfall increases substantially farther south, exceeding 1,500 mm (59.1 in) annually in some areas. extremes in annual precipitation range from 250 mm (10 inches) in the extreme north, to 1800 mm (71 inches) in extreme southern coastal areas.  in the far interior of the country, in the region of tambacounda, particularly on the border of mali, temperatures can reach as high as 54 °c (129.2 °f).

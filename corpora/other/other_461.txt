gameplay
aggressive inline is an extreme sports game that simulates aggressive inline skating, in which the player navigates a series of levels to perform tricks, score points, and complete various objectives. controls involve the use of the d-pad to move and buttons to jump and perform tricks, including grabs, flips, grinds, wallrides and manuals. the player can also interact with environmental elements, such as vaulting from rails, grabbing and spinning around poles, skitching on the back of moving vehicles, and bailing out of tricks.in the game's "career" mode, the player completes a series of seven levels and progresses by completing challenges issued by characters in the level. challenges include the performance of tricks in certain areas or on certain objects, or accumulating points for tricks within a time limit. completion of challenges assigns points to the player, and reaching a threshold of points enables progress to the next level. levels also contain several hidden collectables, allowing the player to unlock hidden areas to other levels, increase their attributes, or unlock special tricks.aggressive inline features several mechanics, including a "juice meter" system in place of a fixed time limit. when the meter is depleted automatically over time, the player runs out of energy and the game is over. the player can replenish the meter by performing tricks or collecting juice boxes throughout the level, allowing them to continue playing indefinitely. an attribute system allows the player to increase the effectiveness of their skater by using experience gained from completing challenges and performing actions and tricks of that attribute in levels. increasing attributes allows the player to improve the performance of speed, jumps, spins, grinds, manuals, fakies, and wallrides.aggressive inline features several secondary game modes. the "tutorial" allows the player to complete 20 lessons to understand gameplay mechanics. in "freeskate" mode, the player can skate without the juice meter in unlocked levels, without being able to complete challenges or upgrade attributes. "timed run" mode allows the player to accumulate points for tricks within a time limit in completed levels. the game also supports multiplayer in which two players can complete head-to-head challenges in modes including getting the most points during a run, performing the best trick, and collecting the most hidden items. the game also features a park editor.the game boy advance version of aggressive inline features several differences from the console version. whilst the player similarly completes challenges across a series of thirteen levels, levels are time-limited, with challenges consisting of objectives including collecting or destroying items, jumping through hoops, and meeting the high score for the stage by accumulating trick points. in addition to the game's main "arcade" and "freeskate" modes, two game boy advance players, connected by a game link cable, can compete for the highest score, highest-scoring trick combo, and combo with most tricks.

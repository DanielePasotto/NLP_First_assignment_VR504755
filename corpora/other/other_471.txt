plot
after a car accident knocks him unconscious, a man awakens from a coma, his face fully bandaged, to find that he has been admitted to a dilapidated sanitarium and that he cannot remember who he is or where he came from, or how he came to be there. his fellow inmates seem to know him simply as "max".
as he delves deeper into the asylum's corridors in search of answers, max finds himself transported to various obscure and otherworldly locations: a small town inhabited only by malformed children and overseen by a malevolent alien entity known only as "mother", a demented circus surrounded by an endless ocean and terrorized by a squid-like individual, an alien hive overrun by cyborg insects, and an aztec village devastated by the return of the god quetzalcoatl. between each episode, max returns to the asylum grounds, blending real and unreal, each time closer to regaining his memory and unraveling the truth surrounding the mysterious dr. morgan, head of the asylum. he remembers the death of his younger sister sarah years ago and the real reason behind his institutionalization. it is revealed that max was working on a cure for a deadly disease, but his rival, jacob morgan, didn't like this. he sabotaged max's car and caused him to have an accident. max is in a coma, trapped in a dreamworld. he must wake up and expose dr. morgan's crimes.

gameplay
the game uses an isometric perspective and a non-tiled 2d navigational system. each world and setting carries a distinct atmosphere that presents either the real world, the imaginary world, or a mix of both of the main protagonist. in many cases, it is unclear to the player if the world the character is currently in is real or a product of max's own imagination. this indistinction underlines much of the horror portrayed in the game.the game is separated into different levels or "chapters" with each having a different style and atmosphere. the player must find clues, solve puzzles and interact with other characters to reach a final challenge where the player must reach the end of a path while avoiding obstacles. if the player fails to do so (by, for instance, getting killed) then the player is transported back to the beginning of the path without losing progress, thus a game over in this game is non-existent. when the player reaches the end of the path, a cinematic is played and the game proceeds to the next chapter.

release

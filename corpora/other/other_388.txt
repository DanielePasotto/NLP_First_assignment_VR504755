history
catholic answers was founded in 1979 by karl keating in response to a fundamentalist protestant church in san diego that was distributing anti-catholic propaganda in the form of tracts placed on the cars of catholics attending mass. he first started by writing a modest tract titled "catholic answers" to counter the arguments he saw in the anti-catholic tract. he distributed it on the windshields of the cars in the fundamentalist protestant church's parking lot. due to the feedback he received from that tract, he published 24 more tracts. in 1988 he quit his law practice and turned catholic answers into a full-time apostolate, with an office and full-time staff.the catholic.com website receives approximately 471,000 visitors per month in an october 2012 estimate.

staff
